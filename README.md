# Git_training_GitHubTest
SandBox to learn how to use Git and Github.

Homework #1 :

1. Create a GitHub account and join the CRNL-Lab organisation. You will need to create a token (used as GitHub password to push) - or use SSH if you know how to.
2. Clone this repository
3. In your local project version, create a text file in the correct folder using a pseudo (ex : alex.txt) and write inside the response to this question :
What is the color of your soks today ?
4. Stage, commit and push your local changes to the general repository
5. Have a look on the project licence : all you add here will be BSD 3-clause open source licenced.
